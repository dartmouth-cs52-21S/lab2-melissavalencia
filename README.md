## What Worked Well
I chose to do the styling focus quiz using mostly css and some javascript. I was able to implement the flip cards using a w3school tutorial. They were surprisingly easy to work with. I was able to add images and text to them. The flex boxes allowed for them to be responsive as well!

## What Didn't
I tried to get the choices to stay flipped once clicked, but I could not figure it out in the end. It would only work for one question and not the rest. Instead, I simply added a border around the choices that were clicked.

## Extra Credit
CSS Transitions (flip-card) and added some complexity to calculations (some count for two results).

## Screenshots
Screenshots showing when one choice is clicked, flipped card when hovered, error message, and result.
